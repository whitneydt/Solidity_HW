In the is repository I have built a smart contract to automate some company's finances to make everyone's lives easier, increase transparency, and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

The profit splitter contracts will do the following:

Pay Associate-level employees quickly and easily.
Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.
This project was created in Remix IDE and uses the Ganache development chain and MetaMask (localhost:8545)
